# Fork note
This fork is designed to allow the jetbot.org notebooks to work with a [cheaper JetBot powered by GPIO pins](https://github.com/franklinzhang12/jetbot). It is assumed that you have already set up that repository (software installation, WiFi setup, motor setup).
1. Follow the [Docker setup](https://jetbot.org/master/software_setup/docker.html), cloning this repo instead in step 3.
1. Be sure to run setup.sh in this repo or the linked one each time the JetBot is booted; this is necessary for powering the motors.
1. You can now follow the Jupyter notebooks as outlined on jetbot.org.

Note: This fork is not guaranteed to be kept up to date. See the repo linked above for more information.

JetBot is an open-source robot based on NVIDIA Jetson Nano that is

* **Affordable** - Less than $150 add-on to Jetson Nano
* **Educational** - Tutorials from basic motion to AI based collision avoidance
* **Fun!** - Interactively programmed from your web browser

Building and using JetBot gives the hands on experience needed to create entirely new AI projects.

To get started, read the [JetBot documentation](https://jetbot.org).
